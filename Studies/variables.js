/** 
 * VARIABLES
 *  The big idea is variables are containers for storing data that can be changed later.Vairables were used in the var
 *  form from around 1995 until 2015 when two new "keywords" were created (let and const). Each keyword has a special task 
 * when called they help a softwear engineer to work as diligently as possible. Variables can have local or global scope.
 * Local variables cannot be accessed out of the function where they are declared, whereas the global variables can be accessed 
 * from anywhere. It is also important to remember that variables are case sensitive and must be initialized before being accessed.
 * Variables are used as idenifiers to access other values such as strings, numbers, arrays, booleans , etc.
 *
 * NOW LETS SEE THEM IN ACTION 
 * 1.) TO create a variable you must use the var, let, or const kyword.
 * followed by the keyword you will want some form of ifentification or tag for the statement that you are about to create.
 * 2.) Secondly you will want to declare and initalize your variable so it can work.
 * this can be done by using the assignment opperator (=).
