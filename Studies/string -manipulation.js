/** 
 * STRING-MANIPULATION
 * string manipulation is when you have to go through a value of a string and change it up.
 * Strings areIn JavaScript a string is not an array of characters but rather an object; and to change or
 *  manipulate a string some functions or methods are required.
 * we can manipulate a string by using operators or methods. 
 * a quick example by using operators can be used simply as 
 * var car = "red";
 * var girl = "Ronny";
 * var sentence =  girl + " drives a really fast " + car + " toyota.";
 * this is using the plus operator to combine strings so the sentence would read 
 * Ronny drives a really fast red toyota.
 * strings can also be manipulated through various methods when using Javascript 
 * this includes:
 * concat(),- joins more than one string together without damaging or changing the original string 
 *indexOf(), -It returns only the first occurrence of a word in a string
 *lastIndexOf(), -method gives the index of the last occurrence of the specified word in the given string
 *charAt(), - finds a character in a specific place in a string 
 *match(), -This method searches the string to match expressions and returns the result as an Array  Object.
 *replace(),- It searches the string for a specific value and then replaces it with the given value 
 *split(), -It splits the string into an array of substrings and returns the new array.
 *splice(),- It simply cuts a specific part of the given string and returns the isolated part. It takes either one or two parameters,
 *length(), -returns the length of a given string (string length of a empty string is 0)
 *substring(),-It takes two parameters, start and end, and returns the characters in these indexes  excluding the end character. 
 *search(),- It searches a word in the string and returns its index. It returns -1 when no match is  found
 *toUpperCase(),- uppercases the letters in a string 
 *toLowerCase(),- lowercases the letters in a string 
 *trim()-This method is used to remove all the whitespace characters (space, tab etc) from both sides of the string
 * There are many methods that you can use on a string but these are some of the more commom methods that one would use to get through a code
