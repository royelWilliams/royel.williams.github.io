/**
 * OPERATORS
 *  well lets start with the fact that operators are very simple however they are very important 
 * when doing almost anything that involves coding. 
 *  This is can can be the big difference in a code passina and failing a test 
 *ALl together there are countless numbers of operators
 * ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: consist of 
 * x = f()	x = f()
 * (+=)Addition assignment	x += f()	
 *(-=)subtraction assignment	x -= f()	
 *(*=)Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	
 *(/=)Division assignment	x /= f()	
 *(%=)Remainder assignment	x %= f()	
 *(*=)Exponentiation assignment	x *= f()
 * these operators help to do simple math within a function o
 * 


 * ARITHMETHIC OPERATORS: consist of the basic operators that we use to do sums 
 * (+)-addition: adds two numbers +"3" returns 3.
 * (-)-subtraction: subtracts two numbers If x is 3, then -x returns -3.
 * (/)-division: divides two numbers 
 * (*)-multiplication:miltiplies two numbers 
 * (%)- remainder:Returns the remainder left over after you've divided the left number into a 12 % 5 returns 2.
 * number of integer portions equal to the right number.
 * (**)- exponential:Raises a base number to the exponent power, that is, the base 2 ** 3 returns 8. 10 ** -1 returns 0.1.
 * number multiplied by itself, exponent times.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * COMPARISON OPERATORS:consist of different values that will in the end help determine if something is true or false in simple terms 
 * (===)- strictly equals:Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another  3 === var1
 * (!==)-not equal:Tests whether the left and right values are not identical to one another 3 !== '3'
 * (<=)-less than or equal to: Tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right one. var1 <= 3
 * (>=)-greater than or equal to :Tests whether the left value is greater than or equal to the right one.var1 >= 3
 * (>)- greater than:Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one."12" > 2
 * (<)- less than: Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one."2" < 12
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * LOGICCAL OPERATORS 
 * (&&)- and: for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true  expr1 && expr2
 * (||)- or:for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. expr1 || expr2
 * (!)-not:the not operator is used when something is not true. !expr
 * 

 * UNARY OPERATORS:
 * (+)-plus: tries to turn a number to a positive +"3" returns 3. +true returns 1
 * (++)-incriment:	Adds one to its operand. If x is 3, then ++x sets x to 4 and returns 4, whereas x++ returns 3 and, only then, sets x to 4.
 * (-)-minus: tried to turn a number to a negative If x is 3, then -x returns -3.
 * (--)-decriment:Decrements by one from its operand If x is 3, then --x sets x to 2 and returns 2, whereas x-- returns 3 and, only then, sets x to 2.
 * (!)-not:Converts to boolean value then negates it(this can change any value/ statement from false to true or vice versa)
 * (typeof)-type of: Returns a string which is the type of the operand(this works with all simple data types it gets more complicated with objects, arrays, etc)
 * (delete)-delete:Deletesspecific index of an array or specific property of an object
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * TERNARY OPERATORS
 * this is often  only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?),
 *  then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. 
 * (a(being the expression or thing that needs to be solved)? b(being true):c(being false))
 * (a?b:c
 * 
 * condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
