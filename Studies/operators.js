/**
 * OPERATORS
 *  well lets start with the fact that operators are very simple however they are very important 
 * when doing almost anything that involves coding. 
 *  This is can can be the big difference in a code passina and failing a test 
 *ALl together there are countless numbers of operators
 * ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: consist of 
 * x = f()	x = f()
 * (+=)Addition assignment	x += f()	
 *(-=)subtraction assignment	x -= f()	
 *(*=)Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	
 *(/=)Division assignment	x /= f()	
 *(%=)Remainder assignment	x %= f()	
 *(*=)Exponentiation assignment	x *= f()
 * these operators help to do simple math within a function o
 * ARITHMETHIC OPERATORS: consist of the basic operators that we use to do sums 
 * (+)-addition: adds two numbers 
 * (-)-subtraction: subtracts two numbers
 * (/)-division: divides two numbers 
 * (*)-multiplication:miltiplies two numbers 
 * (%)- remainder:Returns the remainder left over after you've divided the left number into a 
 * number of integer portions equal to the right number.
 * (**)- exponential:Raises a base number to the exponent power, that is, the base 
 * number multiplied by itself, exponent times.
 * COMPARISON OPERATORS:consist of different values that will in the end help determine if something is true or false in simple terms 
 * (===)- strictly equals:Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another
 * (!==)-not equal:Tests whether the left and right values are not identical to one another
 * (<=)-less than or equal to: Tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right one.
 * (>=)-greater than or equal to :Tests whether the left value is greater than or equal to the right one.
 * (>)- greater than:Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one.
 * (<)- less than: Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one.
 * LOGICCAL OPERATORS 
 * (&&)- and: for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true
 * (||)- or:for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true.
 * (!)-not:the not operator is used when something is not true 
 * UNARY OPERATORS:
 * (+)-plus: tries to turn a number to a positive 
 * (++)-incriment:	Adds one to its operand
 * (-)-minus: tried to turn a number to a negative 
 * (--)-decriment:Decrements by one from its operand
 * (!)-not:Converts to boolean value then negates it(this can change any value/ statement from false to true or vice versa)
 * (typeof)-type of: Returns a string which is the type of the operand(this works with all simple data types it gets more complicated with objects, arrays, etc)
 * (delete)-delete:Deletesspecific index of an array or specific property of an object
 * TERNARY OPERATORS:
 * this is often  only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?),
 *  then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. 
 * (a(being the expression or thing that needs to be solved)? b(being true):c(being false))
 * (a?b:c
