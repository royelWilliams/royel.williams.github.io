/**
 * FUNCTIONS 
 * A function when using javascript is very similar to a procedure it is made to deal with a set statement.
 *  It then proforms task for that statement to calculate and return answers.When you are dealing with functions
 * we have one or more inputs/ outputs.  To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which 
 * you wish to call it. 
 * you want to start by declaring a function 
 * ex.
 * 
 * function 
 * when declairing a function you need to name the function,
 * ex.
 * function  nameHere 
 * Next you want to make a place for your parameters(parameters can 
 * be named anything and they are generally placeholders for values that will be later passed in)
 *  for your function 
 * ex.
 * 
 * function nameHere(parameter, parameter(this can generally hold as many parameters as needed))
 * the next part of your function is the body: this is where the code generally goes
 * ex 
 * 
 * function nameHere(parameter,parameter){
 * this is the body of the function 
 * }
 * following the function you want to impliment a function call 
 * this is usually used to test a certain value in your function
 * ex
 * 
 * call the name of the function and in the parameters have the values that you want to replace the
 * current parameters 
 * nameHere(2,4);
 * 
 * 
 * the 2 and the 4 are the test that will be ran after the function was called
 * Keep in mind that functions can be called at a later point if nessary and reassigned 
 * different input values to test the function and get different results.
 * 
 * When dealing with functions there a few things you want to really pay attention to, like first the difference 
 * in a parameter and a function call
 * Remember a parameter is used as place holders that will go through the function and tell it where the values will
 * be placed and what will be the result of  it. they can be described as the prep for any given function 
 * 
 * An argurment on the othe hand is the real deal an argurment will be placed in the parenthesis of the function call 
 * at the end of the function and the values that are placed will then replace the parameter values and go through the function
 * to return another form of value 
 *
